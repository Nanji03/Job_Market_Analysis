# Job Market Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis #

## Project Overview ##

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a job market dataset aimed at understanding salary trends, job roles, experience requirements, and skill demand across companies.
The analysis focuses on data-related roles, with a deeper dive into Data Scientist positions, and compares compensation across companies and job titles to support career decision-making.


## Questions Explored ##

1. Which companies offer the highest salaries?
2. Which job roles are the highest-paying?
3. How does required experience impact salary?
4. What skills are most in demand for Data Scientist roles?
5. Is switching career paths financially beneficial?

## Tech Stack ##
Python
Pandas – data cleaning and analysis
Plotly Express – interactive visualizations
Jupyter Notebook

## Key Highlights ##
1. Clear salary disparities across companies and job roles
2. Data-focused roles consistently rank among the highest paid
3. Experience and skill specialization significantly affect compensation
4. Career changes do not always lead to higher salaries compared to role specialization
